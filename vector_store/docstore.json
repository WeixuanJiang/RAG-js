I logged the generated OData queries and analyzed them for correctness and efficiency. I discovered that the queries were often too broad, retrieving a large number of documents that were not highly relevant to the specific question. This was due to a flaw in the logic that translated natural language questions into OData syntax.","metadata":{"source":"AWS Interview.docx","chunkIndex":33,"totalChunks":46,"fileType":".docx","processedAt":"2025-08-21T10:23:27.916Z"}}],["54242515-8fd8-4bd3-ad8f-a8e0dc95ca32",{"pageContent":"Context Window: Finally, I investigated the amount of context being passed to the language model.

I implemented the following changes:\n\nImproved Natural Language Processing: I incorporated a more sophisticated NLP library to better understand the nuances of medical terminology and formulate more precise queries.\n\nOData Query Optimization: I refined the logic for constructing OData queries to include more specific filters and better leverage the capabilities of Azure AI Search's hybrid search (keyword and vector search).","metadata":{"source":"AWS Interview.docx","chunkIndex":34,"totalChunks":46,"fileType":".docx","processedAt":"2025-08-21T10:23:27.916Z"}}],["c9867742-0248-4c25-8cd6-92756c7d28d0",{"pageContent":"Context Expansion: I increased the context window for the language model by including the top ten most relevant documents instead of just three.

This involved multiple teams using different scripts and spreadsheets to check row counts, execution status, and data completeness for 65 tables across various schemas. This manual process was error-prone, inefficient, and caused delays in their data migration project.\n\nTask: My task was to automate and simplify the data validation process.
